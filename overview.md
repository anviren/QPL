# Quantum Programming Language (QPL) Documentation

## Introduction

Quantum Programming Language (QPL) is designed for creating adaptive and dynamic systems by treating processes as primary entities. This documentation covers the key concepts, classes, and usage examples of QPL.

## Core Concepts

### Processes as Primary Entities
- Processes are the main components in QPL. They interact, adapt, and generate data in real-time.
- Processes can be in multiple states simultaneously, allowing flexible responses to changing conditions.

### Adaptive Data Types
- Data types in QPL are not fixed. They can dynamically change based on the context, offering a high degree of flexibility.

### Continuous Data Flow
- Data is continuously generated and flows through processes, affecting their behavior in real-time.

### Dynamic Interaction
- Processes interact with each other, exchanging data and adapting their behavior according to the context and results of interactions.

## Key Classes and Functions

### QuantumProgram
- Manages and executes all processes within a program.

### Process
- The base class for all processes, containing methods for starting, interacting, and adapting.

### SuperpositionState
- Represents a set of possible states for a process or object, which can collapse into a specific state based on the context.

### AdaptiveData
- Handles data that can dynamically adapt its type based on the context.

## Example Program
