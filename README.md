# Quantum Programming Language (QPL)

## Overview

Quantum Programming Language (QPL) is an innovative process-oriented programming language designed to manage complex, adaptive systems where processes and data are fluid, continuous, and responsive to their context. QPL introduces concepts such as non-binary states, adaptive data types, continuous data flow, and dynamic process interaction, providing a powerful toolkit for creating flexible and resilient software.

## Key Features

- **Process-Oriented Programming**: Processes are the fundamental units of execution and interaction, taking center stage in QPL.
- **Adaptive Data Types**: Data types are not fixed and can dynamically adapt based on the context, allowing for greater flexibility and adaptability.
- **Superposition of States**: Processes can exist in multiple states simultaneously, with the context determining the active state.
- **Continuous Data Flow**: Data is generated and processed in real-time, influencing ongoing processes and enabling dynamic interactions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get started with QPL, you'll need the following:

- **Python 3.8+**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
- **Git**: To clone the repository and contribute to the project.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/QuantumProgrammingLanguage.git
   cd QuantumProgrammingLanguage

2. **Install dependencies**: If your project has any dependencies, you should list them here. For example, you can use **pip** to install them:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

###Basic Usage
Here's a simple example of how to use QPL:
   ```bash
from qpl import QuantumProgram, DataGeneratorProcess, ObjectManagerProcess, AdaptiveProcess

# Create an instance of QuantumProgram
quantum_program = QuantumProgram()

# Initialize processes
data_gen_process = DataGeneratorProcess("DataGenerator")
object_manager_process = ObjectManagerProcess("ObjectManager")
adaptive_process = AdaptiveProcess("AdaptiveProcess")

# Add processes to the program
quantum_program.add_process(data_gen_process)
quantum_program.add_process(object_manager_process)
quantum_program.add_process(adaptive_process)

# Link processes (define interactions)
def link_processes(gen_process, obj_process, adapt_process):
    while True:
        data = gen_process.state
        if data:
            obj_process.execute(data)
            adapt_process.execute(data)
        time.sleep(1)

# Start the program
thread_link = Thread(target=link_processes, args=(data_gen_process, object_manager_process, adaptive_process))
thread_link.start()

quantum_program.start()
thread_link.join()
```
